# Artificial Neural Networks
AND.py , OR.py, NOT.py are test files for the individual gates to see if they are trained properly

# XOR Problem:
1. Train the AND Gate
2. Train the OR Gate
3. Train the NOT Gate
4. Test is the gates have been trained correctly by checking the output comparing to expected output
5. Implement the XOR Gate by combining the (OR) AND (NOT(AND)) Gates
6. Prompt user to enter input to use on XOR GAte
7. Pass the input into the XOR Gate 
8. Output is printed

# Handwriting recognition :
1. Declare a device
2. Declare hyper variables
3. Get training data
4. Get test data
5. Check data sample
6. View image in gray scaled
7. Build a model of 4 hidden layers
8. Declare cross entropy loss
9. Declare a optimizer 
10. Check size of sample
11. make training loop for neural network
12. Define class to view the classification
