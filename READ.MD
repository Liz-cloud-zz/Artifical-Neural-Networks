# Artificial Neural Networks

# XOR Problem:
1. Train the AND Gate
2. Train the OR Gate
3. Train the NOT Gate
4. Test is the gates have been trained correctly by checking the output comparing to expected output
5. Implement the XOR Gate by combining the (OR) AND (NOT(AND)) Gates
6. Prompt user to enter input to use on XOR GAte
7. Pass the input into the XOR Gate 
8. Output is printed
