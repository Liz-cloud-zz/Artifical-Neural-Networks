# Artificial Neural Networks
AND.py , OR.py, NOT.py are test files for the individual gates to see if they are trained properly

# XOR Problem:
Train the AND Gate

Train the OR Gate

Train the NOT Gate

Test is the gates have been trained correctly by checking the output comparing to expected output

Implement the XOR Gate by combining the (OR) AND (NOT(AND)) Gates

Prompt user to enter input to use on XOR GAte

Pass the input into the XOR Gate

Output is printed

# Handwriting recognition :

Declare a device

Declare hyper variables

Get training data

Get test data

Check data sample

View image in gray scaled

Build a model of 4 hidden layers

Declare cross entropy loss

Declare a optimizer

Check size of sample

make training loop for neural network

Define class to view the classification
